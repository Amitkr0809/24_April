1. what is python.
ans1.Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software,
     automate tasks, and conduct data analysis.
2.what are the feature of python.
ans2.Easy to Code. Python is a very high-level programming language, yet it is effortless to learn. ...
     Free and Open-Source.
     Robust Standard Library.
     Interpreted.
     Portable.
     Object-Oriented and Procedure-Oriented.
3. Is python os case-sensitive.
ans3.yes
4 Is python is a dynamiclly typed programming.
ans4 yes
5. How to perform the arithemitic operations using python.
ans1  1	Addition	x + y
          x = 5
           y = 3
          print(x + y)
      2.Subtraction	x - y
         x=5
         y=2
        print(x-y)
      3.Multiplication	x * y
         x=5
         y=2
        print(x*y)
      4.Division	x / y
         x=8
         y=2
        print(x/y)
      5.Modulus	x % y
         x=5
         y=2
        print(x%y)
      6.Exponentiation	x ** y
	   x=2
         y=5
        print(x**y)
      7.Floor division	x // y
	   x=4
         y=2
        print(x//y)
6.  what is floor division in python.
ans. Floor division is an operation in Python that allows us to divide two
    numbers and rounds the resultant value down to the nearest integer.
	The floor division occurs through the double-backslash (//) operator.
7. What is BODMAS rule.
ANS.BODMAS stands for Bracket, of, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction.
8. what are variable.
ans .A Variable is nothing but a programming element used to define, store, and perform
    operations on the input data.
	Python variables are of four different types: Integer, Long Integer, Float, and String.
9. What are Data types.
ans Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

      Text Type:	str
     Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
    Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
      Mapping Type:	dict
       Set Types:	set, frozenset
     Boolean Type:	bool
     Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray
    None Type:	NoneType
10. Explain some of the bacis data type in python.
ans 1) Numeric --it holds Number
        -> int -  1,2,3,4
        -> float -  1.1,2.2.3.3
        -> complex - 1+1j
      2) string -- it holds sequence of character
            str = "thunder","soft","company",'a','1'
      3) list -- collection of elements inside [], and it is mutable
               l = ["raj",1,10,1.1]
      4) Tuple --collection of elements inside (), and its is immutable
               t =  (10,20,"a")
      5) Set -- Collections of Unique elements inside {}, and it is Mutable
                s = {1,,3,2,4,5}
      6) Frozenset -- Collections of Unique elements inside {}, and it is immutable
                f = {10,2,4,,5}
      7) Dictionary -- collection of element in from of KEY and Value inside {}
                d = {"k":"v","name":"raj"}
      8) Range -- it give range of value and it is Immutable
                r = range(1,10)
      9) None
11. What are the numeric data type in python.
ans Numeric --it holds Number
        -> int -  1,2,3,4
        -> float -  1.1,2.2.3.3
        -> complex - 1+1j
12. What is type conversion or type casting
ans Type conversion is the process of converting a data type into another data type
  eg  b = 3.0
      a = (int) b
